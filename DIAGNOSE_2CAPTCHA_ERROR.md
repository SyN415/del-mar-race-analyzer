# Diagnosing 2Captcha ERROR_METHOD_CALL
## Despite Valid API Key

---

## 🔍 Current Situation

**Status**: ERROR_METHOD_CALL persists even after:
- ✅ User confirmed API key is correct
- ✅ Fixed enterprise parameter (only set when rqdata present)
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded track IDs

**Latest Logs**:
```
✅ 2Captcha solver initialized
🔐 Solving hCaptcha for https://...
   Site key: dd6e16a7-972e-47d2-9...
❌ Error solving captcha via wrapper: ERROR_METHOD_CALL
```

## 🎯 Possible Root Causes

### 1. hCaptcha Not Enabled in Account Settings ⚠️ MOST LIKELY

**Symptom**: ERROR_METHOD_CALL even with valid API key

**Explanation**:
- Your 2Captcha account might not have hCaptcha solving enabled
- This is a setting in your 2Captcha account dashboard
- Even with a valid API key and balance, if hCaptcha is disabled, you'll get ERROR_METHOD_CALL

**How to Check**:
1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/setting
2. Scroll to "Captcha Types" section
3. Look for "hCaptcha" checkbox
4. **It must be checked/enabled**

**How to Fix**:
1. Check the "hCaptcha" box
2. Click "Save Settings"
3. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
4. Test again

---

### 2. Insufficient Account Balance

**Symptom**: ERROR_METHOD_CALL or ERROR_ZERO_BALANCE

**How to Check**:
1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/enterpage
2. Check balance in top-right corner
3. Need at least $0.50 for testing

**How to Fix**:
1. Add funds at: https://2captcha.com/enterpage
2. Minimum $3, recommended $10-20

---

### 3. Account Type Doesn't Support hCaptcha

**Symptom**: ERROR_METHOD_CALL with valid key and balance

**Explanation**:
- Some 2Captcha account types might not support all captcha types
- Free/trial accounts might have limitations

**How to Fix**:
1. Contact 2Captcha support: https://2captcha.com/support
2. Ask: "Does my account support hCaptcha solving?"
3. Upgrade account if needed

---

### 4. API Key Permissions Issue

**Symptom**: ERROR_METHOD_CALL or ERROR_WRONG_USER_KEY

**Explanation**:
- API key might not have permissions for hCaptcha
- Key might be for a different account type

**How to Fix**:
1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/enterpage
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY in Render

## 🧪 Diagnostic Test Script

I've created a test script to diagnose your 2Captcha configuration:

### Run Locally:

```bash
# Set your API key
export TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'

# Run the test
python test_2captcha_config.py
```

### What It Tests:

1. **API Key Format**: Checks if key is 32 characters
2. **Balance Check**: Verifies account has funds
3. **hCaptcha Solving**: Tests with 2Captcha's official demo hCaptcha

### Expected Output (Success):

```
✅ API Key found: 1abc234d...7b8c
   Length: 32 characters
✅ TwoCaptcha solver initialized
✅ Balance check successful: $5.2340
✅ Balance is sufficient ($5.2340)
✅ hCaptcha solved successfully!
   Token: P1_eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...
```

### If It Fails:

The script will provide specific guidance based on the error code.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Script

```bash
export TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
python test_2captcha_config.py
```

**If it passes**: Your 2Captcha config is correct. The issue is specific to Equibase's hCaptcha.

**If it fails**: Follow the error-specific guidance in the script output.

---

### Step 2: Check Account Settings

1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/setting
2. Verify these settings:
   - ✅ hCaptcha is **enabled/checked**
   - ✅ Account is **active**
   - ✅ No IP restrictions (or your Render IP is whitelisted)

---

### Step 3: Check Balance

1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/enterpage
2. Balance should be > $0.50
3. If low, add funds

---

### Step 4: Test with Simple Script

Create a simple test file:

```python
from twocaptcha import TwoCaptcha

solver = TwoCaptcha('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')

try:
    # Test with 2Captcha's demo
    result = solver.hcaptcha(
        sitekey='10000000-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000001',
        url='https://2captcha.com/demo/hcaptcha'
    )
    print(f"✅ Success! Token: {result['code'][:50]}...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
```

Run it:
```bash
python test_simple.py
```

---

### Step 5: Contact 2Captcha Support

If all above steps pass but production still fails:

1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/support
2. Provide:
   - Your account email
   - Error message: "ERROR_METHOD_CALL"
   - What you're trying to solve: "hCaptcha on Equibase.com"
   - Sitekey: `dd6e16a7-972e-47d2-9...`
   - URL: `https://www.equibase.com/smartPick/smartPick.cfm/...`

## 📊 Enhanced Logging

I've added enhanced logging to help diagnose:

```python
# New logs you'll see:
💰 2Captcha account balance: $5.23
🔐 Solving hCaptcha for https://...
   Site key: dd6e16a7-972e-47d2-9...
   URL length: 156 chars
   Extra params: []  # or ['rqdata', 'userAgent'] if present
```

This will help identify:
- Balance issues
- Parameter issues
- URL formatting issues

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

Based on ERROR_METHOD_CALL with valid API key, the **most likely issue** is:

### ⚠️ hCaptcha Not Enabled in Account Settings

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://2captcha.com/setting
2. Find "Captcha Types" section
3. **Check the "hCaptcha" box**
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. Test again

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run diagnostic script**: `python test_2captcha_config.py`
2. **Check account settings**: Enable hCaptcha at https://2captcha.com/setting
3. **Verify balance**: Ensure > $0.50 at https://2captcha.com/enterpage
4. **Test again**: Deploy and check logs for new diagnostic info
