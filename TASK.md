  - [x] Check if there are timeout settings causing premature hangup - NOT THE ISSUE
  - [x] Verify endCallMessage configuration in VAPI assistant - CONFIGURED
  - [x] Examine VAPI assistant's conversation flow settings - PROPER

- [x] **Call Flow Logic Investigation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - ROOT CAUSE FOUND
  - [x] Trace the exact point where the agent stops responding - WEBHOOKS NOT RECEIVED
  - [x] Check if the agent recognizes when all questions are completed - CAN'T RECEIVE EVENTS
  - [x] Verify survey completion detection logic - WEBHOOK ISSUE
  - [x] Analyze if there are race conditions in call termination - WEBHOOK CONFIGURATION MISSING

- [x] **Implementation Fix** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**: Added `serverUrl` to VAPI assistant configuration
  - [x] **WEBHOOK URL**: `${BASE_URL}/vapi-events?tenantId=${tenantId}`
  - [x] **ENHANCED LOGGING**: Added webhook reception and function call detection logs
  - [x] **SERVER MESSAGES**: Added 'function-call' to serverMessages array

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent delivers the complete "Thank you for your feedback. Goodbye!" message after Question 3
- Call terminates gracefully after the closing message
- No silent periods or abrupt hangups
- Consistent behavior across multiple test calls
- Proper call completion logging

### üìä Analytics Call Summary Missing Debug
**Added:** 2025-07-18
**Status:** [ ] Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Debug and fix the missing call summaries on the /analytics page. The system should display a 3-question summary for completed calls but this is not appearing.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Analytics page is loading cost data successfully (279 records, $1.6515, 41 calls)
- Recent calls are being fetched (10 calls compressed to 3072 chars)
- Call logging is working (call_sid 2166e5e8-07d3-4fbd-a6a3-4d15dd0017e1 was logged)
- Missing call summary generation or display logic for the 3-question format

**Subtasks:**

- Completed calls display 3-question summaries on analytics page
- Summaries are generated automatically after call completion
- Summary format is consistent and informative
- Multi-tenant summary data is properly isolated

### üêõ VAPI Assistant Duplication During Test Calls
**Added:** 2025-08-08
**Status:** [/] In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Fix issue where starting a Test Call repeatedly creates new VAPI assistants on every initiation. Assistants should only be created at agent creation (/agents) or when using 'Use in Campaign' from /avatars. Test calls should always re-use the stored assistant ID.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No new assistants are created when initiating test calls
- Assistant creation occurs only in the /agents creation flow or /avatars 'Use in Campaign' pipeline
- Existing agents have their vapiAssistantId updated (if needed) instead of creating duplicates
- Regression tests cover test-call flow without assistant creation

- **Next Steps:** Created comprehensive AI agent integration task to address the identified gaps

---

## üîç Discovered During Work

### üîß Configuration Chain Issues Identified (2025-07-18)
During the debug sweep, several configuration chain issues were discovered:

1. **TwiML Config Disconnect**: The `/config/twiml` form saves mode-specific configurations but doesn't update the main `voiceProvider` field that call routing logic depends on
2. **Agent Selection Gap**: Test call UI allows agent selection but this selection doesn't properly configure the voice provider for the actual call
3. **Avatar Integration Missing**: Avatar personality system exists but isn't connected to the actual voice provider configurations used in calls
4. **Fallback Logic Unclear**: When AI agents fail, the system falls back to survey TwiML without clear error messages or retry logic

These issues have been incorporated into the "End-to-End AI Agent Integration" task above.
