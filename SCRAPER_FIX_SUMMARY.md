# üîß Del Mar Scraper Fix Summary

## üéØ **Root Cause Identified**

The scraper was failing because:

1. **Using old JSON file with placeholder URLs** instead of scraping fresh data
2. **Wrong date** (09/05/2025 instead of 09/07/2025)
3. **No environment variable set** for the race date in the web app
4. **Cached placeholder data** preventing fresh scraping

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated Default Date to 09/07/2025**
- Updated `run_playwright_full_card.py`
- Updated `scrapers/playwright_integration.py`
- Updated `scrape_overview()` function

### **2. Force Fresh Scraping**
- Modified `load_race_card()` to detect placeholder URLs
- Automatically removes files with placeholder data
- Forces fresh scrape when placeholders detected

### **3. Fixed Web App Integration**
- Updated `app.py` to set `RACE_DATE_STR` environment variable
- Added logic to remove old race card files with placeholders
- Proper session data integration

### **4. Enhanced Error Detection**
- Added placeholder URL detection logic
- Better logging for debugging
- Automatic cleanup of bad data files

## üöÄ **How to Test the Fix**

### **Option 1: Test Scraper Directly**
```bash
python3 fix_scraper_test.py
```
This will:
- Remove old files with placeholder data
- Test the race entry scraper directly
- Show you real URLs vs placeholders
- Verify SmartPick URL format

### **Option 2: Test Through Web App**
1. **Deploy the updated code** to Render.com
2. **Go to your web app** and start a new analysis
3. **Use date 09/07/2025** (or any valid Del Mar race date)
4. **Check the logs** for fresh scraping activity

## üîç **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
Total horses in card: 6
Horses with profile URLs: 6
Successfully scraped 1 horses
Opus Uno: 0 results, 0 workouts, quality=50.0
No SmartPick data found for race 1
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
Total horses in card: 60+ (full race card)
Horses with profile URLs: 60+ (all with real refno numbers)
Successfully scraped 60+ horses
Horse Name: 5+ results, 3+ workouts, quality=85.0+
SmartPick data found for 8+ races
```

## üìã **URL Format Verification**

The scraper should now extract URLs in this format:

### **Horse Profile URLs:**
```
https://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno=10956267&registry=T&rbt=TB
```

### **Horse Workout URLs:**
```
https://www.equibase.com/profiles/workouts.cfm?refno=10956267&registry=T
```

### **SmartPick URLs:**
```
https://www.equibase.com/smartPick/smartPick.cfm/?trackId=DMR&raceDate=09%2F07%2F2025&country=USA&dayEvening=D&raceNumber=1
```

## üéØ **Key Changes Made**

### **File: `scrapers/playwright_integration.py`**
- Updated default date to 09/07/2025
- Added placeholder URL detection in `load_race_card()`
- Force fresh scrape when placeholders found

### **File: `app.py`**
- Added `RACE_DATE_STR` environment variable setting
- Added placeholder file cleanup logic
- Proper session data integration

### **File: `run_playwright_full_card.py`**
- Updated default date to 09/07/2025

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still see "No Results Available":**

1. **Check the logs** for scraping activity
2. **Verify the date format** (should be MM/DD/YYYY)
3. **Run the test script** to verify scraper is working
4. **Check for network issues** or Equibase blocking

### **If scraper finds 0 horses:**

1. **Verify the race date** has races at Del Mar
2. **Check the Equibase URL format** is correct
3. **Test with a known good date** like 08/24/2025

### **If you get placeholder URLs:**

1. **Delete the old JSON files** manually
2. **Restart the application** to force fresh scraping
3. **Check the race entry scraper** is parsing correctly

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

Your scraper is working correctly when you see:

- ‚úÖ **Real refno numbers** in horse profile URLs (not PLACEHOLDER)
- ‚úÖ **Full race card** with 40-80+ horses total
- ‚úÖ **Multiple races** (typically 8-12 races per day)
- ‚úÖ **SmartPick data** found for most races
- ‚úÖ **Horse results and workouts** successfully scraped
- ‚úÖ **Quality scores** above 70-80 for most horses

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Render.com
2. **Test with the web interface** using date 09/07/2025
3. **Monitor the logs** for successful scraping
4. **Verify results** show full race analysis

The scraper should now work correctly and provide comprehensive race analysis with real Equibase data instead of placeholder URLs!
