# Docker Deployment Guide for Render.com

## üê≥ Docker Deployment Solution for Playwright Issues

This guide implements the **Docker deployment solution** recommended to resolve Playwright browser installation issues on Render.com. Docker provides complete control over the environment and guarantees consistent browser installation.

## üéØ Why Docker Deployment?

### Problems with Standard Render.com Python Runtime:
- Playwright browsers install during build but get wiped before runtime
- Inconsistent browser availability across deployments
- Cache invalidation issues with browser binaries
- Limited control over system dependencies

### Docker Deployment Advantages:
- ‚úÖ **Complete Environment Control**: Full control over system dependencies and browser installation
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed Browser Installation**: Browsers are baked into the Docker image
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Deployments**: Same environment every time
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-Grade Stability**: Production-ready with proper security
- ‚úÖ **No Runtime Browser Installation**: Browsers are pre-installed in the image

## üìÅ File Structure

```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile          # Optimized Docker configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ render.yaml         # Docker deployment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile              # Original (fallback)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ render.yaml             # Original (environment variable approach)

```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Ensure your repository has the updated Docker configuration:

```bash
# Verify the render-deploy directory exists with updated files
ls -la render-deploy/
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render.com

1. **Go to your Render.com Dashboard**
2. **Create a new Web Service** (or update existing)
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure the service:**
   - **Name**: `del-mar-analyzer-docker`
   - **Runtime**: `Docker`
   - **Dockerfile Path**: `render-deploy/Dockerfile`
   - **Docker Context**: `./` (root directory)
   - **Auto-Deploy**: `false` (recommended for production)

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Render.com dashboard:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=production
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
SCRAPER_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DelMar-Analyzer/1.0; +https://delmar-analyzer.onrender.com)
SCRAPER_HEADLESS=true
SCRAPER_TIMEOUT=45
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEBUG=false
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=0
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Trigger Manual Deployment** from Render.com dashboard
2. **Monitor Build Logs** to ensure Playwright browsers install correctly
3. **Verify Health Check** at `/health` endpoint

## üîß Docker Configuration Details

### Enhanced Dockerfile Features

The updated `render-deploy/Dockerfile` includes:

1. **Proper Environment Variables**:
   ```dockerfile
   ENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
   ENV PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=0
   ```

2. **Comprehensive System Dependencies**:
   - All required libraries for Chromium
   - X11 virtual framebuffer (xvfb)
   - Font and audio libraries

3. **Guaranteed Browser Installation**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps
   RUN python -m playwright install-deps
   ```

4. **Installation Verification**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('Playwright installation verified')"
   ```

5. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Non-root user execution
   - Proper file permissions
   - Health checks

6. **Production Optimizations**:
   - Layer caching optimization
   - Minimal image size
   - Proper port handling

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If the Docker build fails:

1. **Check Build Logs** in Render.com dashboard
2. **Verify System Dependencies** are installing correctly
3. **Ensure Playwright Installation** completes successfully

### Runtime Issues

If the application fails to start:

1. **Check Application Logs** for Playwright errors
2. **Verify Environment Variables** are set correctly
3. **Test Health Check** endpoint

### Browser Issues

If Playwright can't find browsers:

1. **Verify PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH** is set to `/ms-playwright`
2. **Check Browser Installation** in build logs
3. **Ensure Proper Permissions** on browser directories

## üìä Performance Expectations

### Build Time
- **Initial Build**: 5-8 minutes (includes browser download)
- **Subsequent Builds**: 2-4 minutes (with layer caching)

### Runtime Performance
- **Startup Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: ~512MB-1GB
- **Browser Launch**: 2-5 seconds (pre-installed)

## üîÑ Migration from Environment Variable Approach

If you're currently using the environment variable approach:

1. **Backup Current Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp render.yaml render.yaml.backup
   ```

2. **Switch to Docker Deployment**:
   - Use `render-deploy/render.yaml` configuration
   - Update service settings in Render.com dashboard

3. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Verify all functionality works
   - Check Playwright browser availability
   - Monitor performance metrics

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your Docker deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Playwright browsers install during build
- ‚úÖ Application starts without browser errors
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint responds
- ‚úÖ Scraping functionality works consistently
- ‚úÖ No "browser not found" errors in logs

## üéØ Next Steps

After successful Docker deployment:

1. **Monitor Performance** for the first few days
2. **Set up Monitoring** and alerting
3. **Configure Auto-Deploy** if desired
4. **Optimize Resource Usage** based on actual needs
5. **Consider Scaling** if traffic increases

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Render.com Status** page
2. **Review Build and Runtime Logs**
3. **Verify Docker Configuration**
4. **Test Locally** with Docker if possible
