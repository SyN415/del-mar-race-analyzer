# Production Test Analysis - 2025-10-08

## Test Session: SA Track, 10/05/2025

### ‚úÖ What Worked

#### 1. **Circuit Breaker - PERFECT! üéâ**
```
üõë Circuit breaker triggered after race 1: captcha_fail_streak=1 >= threshold=1
Stopping further SmartPick scraping.
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working as designed
- Detected captcha failure on race 1
- Immediately stopped attempting races 2-8
- Prevented memory spiral and restarts
- This is exactly what we wanted!

#### 2. **Race Card Scraping**
```
Total horses in card: 130
Horses with profile URLs: 130
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully scraped race card with all horse profile URLs

---

### ‚ùå Issues Found & Fixed

#### Issue #1: Hardcoded Track ID (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem**:
```
Prepared 0 horses with profile URLs after overview verification
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `playwright_integration.py` line 328 was hardcoded to use `'DMR'`
- Test was for SA track, so DMR overview horses didn't match SA card horses
- Result: 0 horses matched, scraping aborted

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before:
overview = await entry_scraper.scrape_card_overview('DMR', date_str, 'USA')

# After:
track_id = os.environ.get('TRACK_ID', 'DMR')
overview = await entry_scraper.scrape_card_overview(track_id, date_str, 'USA')
```

**Commit**: `9f7b3e9`

#### Issue #2: Race Count Detection Failed
**Problem**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not determine race count, using default of 8
```

**Expected**: Should detect 10 races for SA on 10/05/2025

**Fix Applied**:
- Added detailed logging to understand why detection fails
- Improved error messages
- Enhanced fallback behavior
- Will see more diagnostic info in next test

**Commit**: `9f7b3e9`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Requiring Attention: 2Captcha API

#### Problem: ERROR_METHOD_CALL
```
‚ùå Error solving captcha via wrapper: ERROR_METHOD_CALL
‚ùå Fallback error solving captcha: ERROR_METHOD_CALL
```

**What This Means**:
This is a **2Captcha API error**, not a code issue. Possible causes:

1. **Invalid API Key Format**
   - Check that `TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY` is correctly formatted
   - Should be a 32-character hex string

2. **Insufficient Balance**
   - Check balance at: https://2captcha.com/enterpage
   - Each hCaptcha solve costs ~$0.003

3. **API Key Permissions**
   - Ensure the API key has hCaptcha solving enabled
   - Some keys are restricted to specific captcha types

4. **Account Status**
   - Verify account is active and in good standing

**How to Check**:
```bash
# Check balance via API
curl "https://2captcha.com/res.php?key=YOUR_API_KEY&action=getbalance"

# Should return: OK|12.34 (balance in USD)
```

**Workaround**:
The circuit breaker now prevents this from causing memory issues. The system will:
- Attempt to solve captcha on race 1
- If it fails, stop immediately
- Continue with whatever data was already collected
- No memory spiral or restarts

## Summary of Changes Deployed

### Commit 1: `eb84df8` - Circuit Breaker Integration Fixes
- Fixed orchestration_service.py async usage
- Removed unnecessary try-except blocks
- Cleaned up code

### Commit 2: `9f7b3e9` - Track ID and Race Count Fixes
- Fixed hardcoded 'DMR' to use TRACK_ID env var
- Added detailed logging for race count detection
- Improved error messages

---

## Next Test Expectations

When you test again, you should see:

### 1. **Track ID Fix**
```
Fetching overview for SA on 10/05/2025
Overview returned 10 races
Built allow list for 10 races
Matched 130 horses from overview
Prepared 130 horses with profile URLs after overview verification
```

### 2. **Race Count Detection**
```
üîÑ Trying HTTP fallback for race count from https://...
HTTP fallback status: 200
Found race numbers in HTML: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
‚úÖ (HTTP fallback) Found 10 races on card
```

### 3. **Circuit Breaker** (if captcha still fails)
```
üõë Circuit breaker triggered after race 1
```
This is expected until 2Captcha issue is resolved.

## Action Items

### Immediate
1. ‚úÖ Deploy latest code (already pushed to GitHub)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Check 2Captcha API key and balance
3. üß™ Test again with SA track

### If 2Captcha Issue Persists
**Option A**: Fix API Key
- Verify key format and permissions
- Add balance if needed

**Option B**: Alternative Captcha Solver
- Consider Capsolver or Anti-Captcha
- Both have better hCaptcha support

**Option C**: Accept Partial Data
- Circuit breaker prevents crashes
- System continues with available data
- May be acceptable for testing

## Environment Variables to Check

```bash
# Required
TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Check this!
TRACK_ID=SA                        # Now properly used
RACE_DATE_STR=2025-10-05          # Format: YYYY-MM-DD

# Optional Circuit Breaker Tuning
SMARTPICK_CIRCUIT_BREAKER=1       # 1=enabled, 0=disabled
SMARTPICK_CB_THRESHOLD=1          # Failures before stopping
```

---

## Success Metrics

After this deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Correct track ID used (SA not DMR)
- ‚úÖ 130 horses matched and prepared for scraping
- ‚úÖ 10 races detected (not 8)
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker prevents memory issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2Captcha still needs attention

The system is now much more robust and will handle failures gracefully!
