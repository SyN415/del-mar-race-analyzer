# üöÄ Del Mar Race Analyzer - Deployment Guide

## Render.com Deployment Fix

The deployment failure you encountered is due to Playwright requiring system-level browser installation that needs root privileges. Here's how to fix it:

### üîß Quick Fix Options

#### Option 1: Use the Updated Build Configuration (Recommended)

I've created several files to fix the deployment:

1. **`render.yaml`** - Updated Render configuration
2. **`build.sh`** - Custom build script that handles Playwright gracefully
3. **`start.sh`** - Production startup script
4. **`Dockerfile`** - Alternative Docker deployment
5. **`scrapers/fallback_scraper.py`** - Fallback scraper when Playwright fails

#### Option 2: Simple Build Command Override

In your Render.com dashboard, update the build command to:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium || echo "Playwright install failed - using fallback"
```

### üìÅ Files Added/Modified

#### New Deployment Files:
- `render.yaml` - Render.com service configuration
- `build.sh` - Custom build script (executable)
- `start.sh` - Production startup script (executable)
- `Dockerfile` - Docker deployment option
- `scrapers/fallback_scraper.py` - Fallback scraper for when Playwright fails

#### Modified Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Added Gunicorn for production
- `app.py` - Added production/development mode handling
- `services/orchestration_service.py` - Added fallback scraper support

### üéØ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push the new files:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add deployment configuration and fallback scrapers"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update Render.com settings:**
   - Build Command: `./build.sh`
   - Start Command: `./start.sh`
   - Or use the `render.yaml` configuration

3. **Set environment variables in Render.com:**
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Your OpenRouter API key
   - `ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production"
   - `PORT` - Will be set automatically by Render
   - `LOG_LEVEL` - Set to "info"

### üîÑ Fallback Strategy

The application now includes a fallback strategy:

1. **Primary:** Tries to use Playwright for full scraping capabilities
2. **Fallback:** Uses requests + BeautifulSoup for basic scraping
3. **Demo Mode:** Provides demonstration data when scraping fails

This ensures the application works even if Playwright installation fails.

### üê≥ Alternative: Docker Deployment

If Render.com continues to have issues, you can use the included `Dockerfile`:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t del-mar-race-analyzer .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key del-mar-race-analyzer
```

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check the build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Try the Docker approach** as an alternative
3. **Use the fallback scraper** by setting environment variable `USE_FALLBACK_SCRAPER=true`

#### Common Issues:

- **Playwright installation fails:** The app will automatically use fallback scrapers
- **Memory issues:** Reduce the number of concurrent scraping operations
- **Timeout issues:** Increase timeout values in environment variables

### üéâ Expected Behavior

After successful deployment:

1. **Application starts** on the assigned port
2. **Fallback scrapers activate** if Playwright is unavailable
3. **Demo data is provided** for testing the interface
4. **AI features work** with OpenRouter API key
5. **Full functionality** available once Playwright is properly installed

### üìû Next Steps

1. **Deploy with the new configuration**
2. **Test the application** with demo data
3. **Configure Playwright** for full scraping (if needed)
4. **Add your OpenRouter API key** for AI features

The application is designed to be resilient and will work even with limited scraping capabilities, allowing you to test the full interface and AI features immediately.

**Note:** The fallback scrapers provide demonstration data that allows you to test all features of the application. Once Playwright is properly configured, you can switch back to full scraping capabilities.
